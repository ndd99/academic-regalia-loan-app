Topics Discussed  
We discussed our plans for break and complted the assignment that went with it. We all plan to do our own independent work to improve in certain ways. We plan to make small contributions
to the project. Collin is going to implement the date available filter and then combine it with the variation filter. Evan plans to make small UI fixes and Brevin is going to 
fix the upload image issue as it appears the file type changed. 

Things Clarified  
- We are going to meet one more time in Decemember to touch base on what small things we are doing and then we will meet again before January 7. This is when we are meeting with 
Ball State's networking department to start the implementation of Ball State's SSO service. We have accomplished a lot so far so we are going to take a more casual approach 
to the project over break.
