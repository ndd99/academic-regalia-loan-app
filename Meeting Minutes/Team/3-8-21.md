# Topics Discussed
We met to discuss the different facets of our presentation for the upcoming presentation. We compiled the feedback we received into our Iteration 4 Presentation.  We also spoke about what must be done for the fifth iteration, such as streamlining the dashboard and making the UI look nicer.  We also discussed the plans for each of us to be able to do this: Evan was to streamline the dashboard, Collin was to work on the listing items page, Nick was to continue working on integrating the SSO, and Brevin was to tighten up the back-end to make it more secure.
# Things Clarified
We decided to meet again on Thursday to go over what we will show during the presentation time.
We reached out to Networking about our times to be able to meet to set up the remaining pieces for the SSO integration.
