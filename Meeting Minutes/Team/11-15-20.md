## Topics Discussed  
We made sure everyone was on the same page in the setting up the development environment. Once we we knew everyone was able to get the application running on their own machines, we discussed who would be working on what pages. We also discussed the need to meet with the client to ask questions about the BSU_registered table, and how we can create logins for testing the application.
Once we had discovered the need to meet with the client, we discussed what times would work for us in the next few days.
