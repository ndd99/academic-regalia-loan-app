## Topics Discussed  
We started the presentation for iteration 1 and talked about how we wanted to do it. After getting that out of the way, we talked about our progress for iteration 2 and how we were going 
to go about it. Evan is starting on converting to SASS and Brevin is working on adding the item variation back to the database and the listing screen. Nick is working on finalizing
the migration from CakePHP 3 to version 4. Collin will be working on making pages responsive and converting to SASS. 

## Things Clarified  
We will meet Monday before the presentation to discuss who is going to present what and to make sure we are good to go. One thing we have started doing is using discord for team meetings
becuase it is easier than Zoom. We usually just join when we are working an others join if they want to discuss any issues they may have. We think this approach is working much better. We
will meet a few times this week to make sure we are on track with accomplishing what is necessary for iteration 2. Also, we will get back to Graham for when we want to schedule a meeting
with the Ball State networking department so we can use their log in system.
