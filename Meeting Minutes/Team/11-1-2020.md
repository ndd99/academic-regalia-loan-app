# Topics Discussed
We began by discussing the compare your team assingment. We decided to make a google doc to begin writing in and copy/paste it into the canvas submission. We already watched all of the videos and took notes so we discussed our notes and started answering the questions in the doc. We all took different sections then added to where we thought needed. 

# Things Clarified
We should all continue looking into cake php as development is officially beginning.
