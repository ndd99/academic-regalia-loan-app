We discussed what we need to do to complete iteration 2 and who will be completing what sections that remain. We also discussed a error we are recieving in CakePHP surrounding the misuse of a CSRF token. We also discussed what times we would be free to present our iteration presentation, we are still working on finding a time that works for everyone.
