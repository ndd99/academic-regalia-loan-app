We discussed what we need to complete for the closure assignment. We also discussed what times we are avaliable to meet with Graham for the final meeting. 
We sent the client an email to set that meeting up, once we get a reply we are going to meet again to do the presentation after speaking with Graham. We also discussed the final bug fixes we need to complete so that the application is working properly for the client.
