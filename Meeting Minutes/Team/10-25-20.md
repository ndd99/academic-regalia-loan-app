# Topics Discussed
We discussed how we are going to apporach this presentation, specifically talking about what slideshow software we will be using and the content within the slideshow. We made sure everyone was comfortable using this tool for our presentation before we picked it. We also portioned out the work needed for the presentation. We were all given slides to complete before presentation day. We are focusing on this document we originally created for our design meeting with our client. This ensures we each know all of the details for each section in the presentation. 

# Things Clarified
Collin will complete slides for business requirements and functional/nonfunctional requirements, Brevin will complete the domain model slide, Evan will complete the prototype and tech stack slides, and Nick will do the use cases slides. Once these are complete we will come together and build our presentation before design day. We also planned a meeting for tomorrow (10/26/2020) at 1pm to finalize our presentation together.
