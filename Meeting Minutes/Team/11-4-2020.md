# **Topics Discussed**
We replicated the development environment from instructions given by the last team. We ran into an issue with getting the database info because we need AWS credentials in order to access
the endpoints. Once we get this setup, we will be moving into the develpment phase with reworking the UI and upgrading the code base being the two big tasks for the first iteration.
We plan to meet again this week to discuss what we do first. We are all learning CakePHP in order to be more comfortable once we start fixing the UI. 
 
# **Things Clarified**
We discussed that we need to meet again tomorrow November, 5 to make sure we each have a stable development environment. We will then start upgrading the code and fixing the UI.
We will more than likely to meet again towards the end of the week to discuss where we are at an how we will move forward.
