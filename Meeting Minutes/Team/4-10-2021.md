# Topics Discussed 
We started the meeting with the goal to complete the SSO and update the database in AWS. Evan connected to the MySQL workbench and was able to connect to the AWS endpoint and 
change the database schema. We then focused on getting the SSO to operate how we wanted it to. We got to the point where users are being added to the database and storing their 
BSU information. We worked all day on this and we got close to finishing. We had to change the auth component in order to fix the multiple sessions being created which was 
crashing the entire site. 
# Things Clarified
We plan to meet tomorrow to finish the app and get everything working how we want. We are trying to get in touch with Keith so we can have our mentor meeting and then we 
plan to meet with Graham on Monday to show him the finished app.
