# **Topics Discussed**
Talked about UI and what changes need to be made to the original project. We each made accounts and tested what each feature did to see if we could break it. This will help us decide where we need to start.
 We found out that we need to be able to resend verification emails to the user because they will expire and then there is no way to verify your account.
 Brevin talked about how we need to update the code to its latest version. We are going to completely rework most of the UI as there are many things that could be done
 to make it look better. Brevin is going to focus on looking at how the database is used and how we can make changes in necessary. Evan will work out 
 a prototype for the landing page and then start on the side pages. We may create an entire dashboard for the user as it will make things much 
 more organized as the pages right now are mostly blank. Colin mentioned changing the forms to be made with React or Vue as Graham said it is something
 he would like to be done. 
 
# **Things Clarified**
 We discussed when the next meeting would be and decided on Thursday, October, 1 at 1:00 p.m. Before we meet, we are all going to look over the code and get familiar with it and Evan
 is going to work on the prototypes.
