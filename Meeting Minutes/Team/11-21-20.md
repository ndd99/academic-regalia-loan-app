## Topics Discussed  
We started finalizing the first iteration and fixed our issues with testing. We found that running tests through the command line did not work and instead used PHP Storm.
This allowed us to write tests making sure we got the correct response code on all the pages we created. We need to finish the profile pages, update the dashboard and add
a phone number column to the database because this information is asked from the user. Overall, we are in a good spot and are close to finishing.

## Things Clarified  
We will meet tomorrow to finish and submit everything. Evan, Collin, and Brevin are writing tests and then will combine them with each other tomorrow. We need to finish the deployment
documentation as that is the last one we need to do. Nick has done the development and the user documentation.
