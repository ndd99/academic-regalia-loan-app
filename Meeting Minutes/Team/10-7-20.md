# Topics Discussed
Started discussing the assignments needed before the next client meeting. Since we're building off an existing project, most of it should be simple. A few we will do in the meeting, but the rest we will split up. We discussed our tech stack being mostly predecided with a few minor changes, such as adding React to handle forms, rather than just pure PHP. Discussed IDE and PHPstorm was chosen. Nick brought up a an additional mailer but Brevin said that the mailer was updated in cakePHP 4, so we would not have to worry.

# Things Clarified
Colin will do business requirements Nick will do Use Cases, Brevin will do Domain model, Evan will continue prototyping, we will meet tuesday at 1:30 for the remaining things and again Sunday the 18th at 6pm for clean-up .
