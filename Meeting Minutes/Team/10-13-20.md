# Topics Discussed
We discovered that functional requirements were needed for a lot of the things we planned on doing between this meeting, and the last so not everything is done. This is not a problem as we allocated time for this, and now that we can discuss it it'll be done a lot quicker. Nick finished Use cases aside from linking to business requirements, so we start there. Colin had a few down, but since we are not making a profit, they are a little strange. We decide to simultaneously work on requirements and business requirements as they are closely related. We came up with a few good business requirements and linked them to the use cases. We discussed how to write the requirements and began that.

# Things Clarified
Collin will finish requirements, and brevin will finish domain model. All things except first iteration features will be done before the next meeting which will be Sunday October 16th at 6pm.
