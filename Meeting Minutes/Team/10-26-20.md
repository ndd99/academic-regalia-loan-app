# Topics Discussed
We all discussed the slides that we had created for design day. Most of what everyone had was good, but some were changed to have the format consistent. We changed the order of some of the slides so that we did not have the same person talking for an extended period of time. We also added a client information slide as was mentioned in the slack.

# Things Clarified
Meet at 2:30 for the presentation tomorrow at 2:40.
