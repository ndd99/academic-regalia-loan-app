## Topics Discussed 
We started the meeting by going through all that is left to finish for this iteration. We need to fix a few pages as the UI could be improved from it's current form. The message
system has been completed and does everything we need it to for this iteration. We then used the majority of the meeting to setup Docker. We finally made progress and we just need to figure out how to get composer to install through the dockerfile. Once we finish that, we can
push the file to repository and we will be done with Docker. 

## Things Clarified  
We plan to meet tomorrow to finish the Dockerfile and then any other last minute changes before the iteration is due Monday. We also need to create the presentation so we will also start this
tomorrow. We will meet Monday to gather all of the iteration materials and submit them.
