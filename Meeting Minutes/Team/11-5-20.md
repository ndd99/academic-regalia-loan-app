## Topics Discussed  
We continued setting up or development environment and helped each other work out any issues we had while setting up XAMPP. We also discussed our approach to starting development, we thought creating a dummy database in the meantime would be helpful in continuing development since we do not need it for the first iteration.
Things Clarified
We clarified what needs to be done for this project to continue smoothly. We will all be getting on this weekend to work on the project and also help each other with problems.
