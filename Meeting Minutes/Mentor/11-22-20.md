# Topics Discussed
Evan shared his screen to show Keith the progress we have made so far. We discovered an error in loading some pictures in the view items tab and took some time to troubleshoot that. Keith was impressed overall at the progress made on the site. We then showed him the documentation that we currently have done. He said it looks very thorough and he plans on following it sometime soon and sharing the results. We discussed the future of the class and decided we may meet sometime before the end of the semester, but we may not have to. 
# Things Clarified
Possible meeting in 2 weeks, if needed.
