# Topics Discussed
We talked about our progress for the first iteration and any issues we were having. Collin and Brevin have completed the register, login, and dashboard pages. Evan is working on
making the nav work as an element across one page and the homepage. We split up the remaining pages for each person to work on. Keith gave us a few tips on testing the project
and how to go about that. Evan is having issues with pushing to GitHub and is fihuring that out. Nick has been recording his findings while trying to update the code to CakePHP 4.0.
Keith gave us a few tips on styling the dashboard with Bootstrap because there was a bit of confusion in that area. Overall, we are on track and hope to have the UI done by Wednesday so
we can complete testing and work on the documentation of this iteration.

# Things Clarified
Keith explained that if we have any issues, to contact him and he will help. We will meet early in the week to see how things are going and what we want to work on next. Finishing the 
UI is the main priority at this point.
