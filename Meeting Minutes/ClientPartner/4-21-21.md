# Topics Discussed
We talked about the final few things that needed to be fixed for the website, as well as the future of what we will all be doing. Graham told us that he was to be leaving the position, so the project will be left with someone else. He read an email from Melinda, who was the person who originally wanted the site to be created, and she was impressed with our work.

# Things Clarified
This was the last time we plan on meeting with Graham.
