# Topics Discussed  
We started the meeting off by going through every page of the website showing off the new UI and then we demonstrated the functionality and the changes we made. Graham thought it looked  
good and liked the progress we made. He did mention a few small things like when listing a new item, the user ID shows up as an input box which is something we were using for a 
quick fix until we implemented the complete feature in the backend. He also wants us to make changes to the item details. We need to add a variation column to the database for the 
cap so a user can filter by variation. This is something we will implement in the next iteration. Graham mentioned that the contact page we made may not be needed. We made a simple form 
that is not connected to any email and he mentioned that he is not sure where we should direct users who have questions and that is a feature to worry about later. After showing him the working 
project, we talked about the documentaion and he mentioned linking the user documentation somewhere on the site for new users who have questions. He said everything was very detailed
and looked good. We talked about our issues with migrating to CakePHP 4 and he gave us a fix to one of the plugins so we will now update it with the updated plugin. One of the biggest 
features that Graham wants implemented is using Ball State's login system and we talked about when we want to do that and when to setup the meetings with the Ball State Networking 
department. Overall, Graham liked the progress that we made and we will make all the small changes that he wants in the next iteration.


# Things Clarified
We will discuss possible meeting dates with the group and see when we can meet with Ball State's networking department. This will take place early next semester and then we will implement it
in the 3rd iteration hopefully. Until then, we will continue to learn CakePHP and make the changes to filtering and the necessary detail changes for the items for the 2nd iteration.
