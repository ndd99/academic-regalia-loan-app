# Topics Discussed  
This meeting we discussed the current state of the application and what final changes need to be made. Graham was able to login to our website using the production URL through BSU SSO. Integrating SSO integration was a top priority this iteration and he was happy with how we did. Graham went through each page of the website talking about things he would like to see changed, he mentioned that we should standardize our wording across all pages. He pointed out a table that does not need to be paginated and would like to see the pagination controls removed. We also discussed some of the steps that are required for deployment. Overall, Graham was very pleased with the state of the application and thinks we nailed every feature that was requested.


# Things Clarified
We clarified what final touches need to be made and how we will move forward. Graham mentioned that we will need to compile a list of the items that are not fully complete and send it to him once we do the hand over. Currently we are waiting for an update for what we need to do next, then we will schedule another meeting with Graham if required.
