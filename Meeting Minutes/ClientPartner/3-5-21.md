# Topics Discussed  
We started the meeting by showing Graham a few errors that were failing in our project, he was able to provide a solution that allowed us to move forward. Graham also helped us configure our SimpleSAMLPHP setup, which is something that is holding back SSO integration. We told Graham that we will be showcasing the project at the Student Symposium and he had no issues with that. We asked what would be allowed to be shared, and he gave us permission to share anything besides passwords, API keys, and anything confidential. Graham mentioned that using the BSU logo in our presentation should be fine since the project has been supported by the BSU networking team and is being developed for the university.

We discussed the current progress of the application and Graham is pleased with the state of it. Graham was able to pull the latest version of the application onto his local machine and run it with no issues, once he had it up and running Graham started to play around with it and see if he could find potential issues. Once Graham finished going through a page, he shared his thoughts with us on what could be changed and improved. We took note of each thing he mentioned, such as redesigning the dashboard to be more concise and breaking up the items into separate pages, that way the user can filter items more efficiently. Graham also mentioned that he would like to see the SSO implemented this next iteration, this is the main priority and will be something that needs to be done before deployment.


# Things Clarified
We clarified what needs to be fixed on the website and now have a list of functional and non-functional issues with the application. We also clarified that SSO needs to be implemented before deployment, which will be this next iteration.
