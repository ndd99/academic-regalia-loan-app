# Topics Discussion
## Business Requirements
    Collin presented the Business Requirements.

    We were unable to come up with any financial goals, within this project.  The focus for the Business Requirements were focused on non-fiancial aspects.  The main goals were are to attach this program to Ball State.

    Graham suggested that we could add the functionality of the project, such as the relationship between borower and lender.

    Graham was happy with the understanding.

## Functional Requirements
    Evan presented the Functional Requirements.

    Since we are basing our current project off of the old project, there was nothing that we needed to add functionality wise.  However we are cleaning up the code and making it look more like a Ball State entity.

    Graham was satisfied.

## Use Cases
    Nick presented the use cases.

    Graham mentioned a possiblity to add the browse item use case, if there was none.

    Graham was happy with the understanding.

## Tech Stack
    Nick presented the Tech Stack.

    Graham mentioned that if none of us have react experience, than it is recommened.  However, he is advising us that we can do in normal JS, as react has a high learning curve.

    Graham is satisfied with our choices within our tech stack, ecspecially with our choice with PHP Storm.  He also recommends to adding a testing service, his recommendation is TravisCI, and PHP Code Sniffer.

## Prototype
    Evan presented the prototype.

    Graham is pleased with the prototype, and the only note he gave is that there should be a "no-image" provided if people do not upload a photo.  He also gave the opinion about how if there is dummy text, then the text should be placed with a purpose. There should be a name, variation, notes, and color option for the user to enter when describing a listing.

## Domain Model
    Brevin presented the Domain Model.

    We do not forsee this software to be large, so our domain is small.  The only required interactions and relationships that are within the software.  The only relationships are: Account -> Item, Item -> Reservation, and Account -> Reservation.

    Graham is satisfied with the domain model, and a short discussion about what the domain model is, and what it isn't.  The Domain Model is different than an Entity Relationship model.

## First Iteration Features
    Evan went over the First Iteration Features

    CakePHP v.4 was brought up, which is what Graham recommends.

    Graham was pleased.

## Final Insights
    Graham beleives the update to Cake PHP v.4, and making it more Ball State are the most important things, and will take the longest, as there are a lot of moving parts, and many people are involved.

    The next meeting will be held on the 19th of November at 4pm.

# Clarifications for Questions

## Chat Functionality
    Graham agrees that this could be beneficial, however he mentions that it should be given purpose to exist.  Graham also mentioned that this was planned for the former team, however it should be on the lower end of the priority scale.  Graham's opinion, is that this should still be at the lower end of the priority scale.

## Amazon Server
    There are credientials within the github repo, to access the Amazon Server.  Graham is comfortable with the credentials being where they are as this is a private repo.
