# Inconviniences
* no forgot password option
* no update when reservation is changed
* no info on picture upload
* can reserve own items
* variation column is a little strange (maybe just have notes)
* cannot change picture once uploaded
* buttons do not work as expected
* When a reserved item is clicked on it says "No reservations for this product have been found"
* Error page does not have much info
* Reservation edit errors are unclear
* no way to approve a previously declined reservation after updating the terms

# Needed Additions
* option to upload multiple pictures
* allow users who are not logged in to see items available (not sure if needed after SSO integration)
* make picture required (?)
* add notes when attempting to reserve an item


# Design flaws
* capitalization inconsistent
* Regalia share in header is not clickable
* Some drop down menus look strange
* improve look of landing page
