# Business Requirements

### BR1: Achieve a customer satisfaction measure of at least 80% within 3 months of the release.  
    We need a way to measure the level of satisfaction a user experiences in the first 3 months of the release, this way we can see if we are meeting the requirements the client proposed properly. Having a defined goal allows us to determine if we need to continue improving on current features or move forward with new ones. This is a nonfinancial goal and will provide us with important data that we can use to see if we need to go back to a previous step in the development lifecycle. 

### BR2: Remain at no cost by using free tools and software.  
    We need to keep using free software that is included in the current tech stack. If we can remain at no costs for the project, then the product will be sustainable for the school to keep up and running. This is a business requirement because it deals with the cost of development. This will also increase the longevity of the application as we will not have to rely so heavily on 3rd party applications, and how long they will be around. 

### BR3: Use pre-established Ball State technology.  
    Using pre-established Ball State technology such as their AWS server, login system, and more will allow the development to be inexpensive. This will also allow the application to be seamlessly integrated into the family of Ball State software available online, this will increase the network of applications and help users find other resources through the university.
